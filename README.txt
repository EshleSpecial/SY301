Lab 3 Benchmark questions 

1) The Big-O run time for a single function of append would be O(1) because the algorithm has to allocate memory for the same
 number of items as the input for the list.

2) The Big-O run time for a single function append5 is O(1) because you are only adding 5 items to the list.

3) The Big-O run time for a single function call of the appendDouble is O(2N) because we are doubling and 
appending whatever amount N is.

4)The approach I believe to be actually used is the single append function in Python because you can append 
however many items into a list and not have none types in a list.

5) The runtime for an insert function is O(1) however when we are inserting an object into the middle of an
list it has a big-o of O(N) because you have to shift the elements of the list before and after where you
insert the value. It is more complex this way by inserting in the middle of an array, you have to shift the 
elements.
